          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <p>
            Outland is a nonprofit organization supporting publishing, public programs, and
            education about art and technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outland is building on the editorial and curatorial work of a pioneering startup of the
            same name, which commissioned and sold digital editions by leading contemporary
            artists that helped define what a fine-art approach to blockchain-based media could look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re working to preserve the archive of essays, reviews, and interviews published by
            Outland from November 2021 to June 2024, and present it in new formats. Thanks for
            your patience as we pursue this undertaking. Please feel free to contact us if you need
            specific materials that were published by Outland in this period.

               is an afternoon of talks on November
              15 about how artists make meaning with game engines, motion capture, and other new
              technologies. The speakers are artists Sam and Andy Rolfes of Team Rolfes, curators
              Xin Wang and Julia Kaganskiy, and game designers Julián Cordero and Flan Falacci.
              The event is organized by Outland and hosted by Amant in Brooklyn, in conjunction with

              “<a href="https://designresearch.sva.edu/home/events/the-machine-is-the-message" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reading and Writing in the Age of AI</a>” is a panel on November 20 with Cliff Kuang and
              Maryam Monalisa Gharavi, two thinkers who bring backgrounds in critical and
              journalistic writing to their work in the tech industry. They’ll discuss how voice, design,
              and interaction shape our relationship to language in an age of intelligent systems. The
              panel marks the beginning of workshop on machine learning applications as writing
              tools and objects of critical inquiry, organized by Outland in partnership with D-Crit, the
              MA program in Design Writing, Research, and Criticism at the School of Visual Arts.
